Prerequisites
=============

Most of the tests require Google Protocol Buffers (>= 2.3.0). It can be
downloaded from here:

    http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list

"cpp" test requires Protocol Buffers headers and .so libraries. If they are
installed to a non-standard path, use "export CXXFLAGS= -I <headers path> -L
<library path>" command to specify their locations. For example, if Protobuf is
installed to "/opt/local", the command will be:

    export CXXFLAGS="-I/opt/local/include/ -L/opt/local/lib"

"proto" test requires access to Protobuf source directory. See
proto/README for details.
